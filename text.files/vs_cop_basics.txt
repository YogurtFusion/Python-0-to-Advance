GitHub Copilot: You can ask me general programming questions, or chat with the following participants which have specialized expertise and can perform actions:



- workspace - Ask about your workspace
	* [/explain] - Explain how the code in your active editor works
	* [/tests]- Generate unit tests for the selected code
	* [/fix]- Propose a fix for the problems in the selected code
	* [/new] - Scaffold code for a new file or project in a workspace
	* [/newNotebook] - Create a new Jupyter Notebook
	* [/fixTestFailure] - Propose a fix for the failing test
	* [/setupTests] - Set up tests in your project (Experimental)
- [vscode] - Ask questions about VS Code
	* [/search]- Generate query parameters for workspace search
	* [/startDebugging]- Generate launch config and start debugging in VS Code (Experimental)
- [terminal]terminalPane - Ask how to do something in the terminal
	* [/explain]. - Explain something in the terminal
- [github] - Get answers grounded in web search, code search, and your enterprise's knowledge bases



You can also help me understand your question by using the following variables to give me extra context:
* `#editor` - The visible source code in the active editor
* `#selection` - The current selection in the active editor
* `#terminalLastCommand` - The active terminal's last run 
* `#terminalSelection` - The active terminal's selection
* `#file` - Choose a file in the workspace



To have a great conversation, ask me questions as if I was a real programmer:

* **Show me the code** you want to talk about by having the files open and selecting the most important lines.
* **Make refinements** by asking me follow-up questions, adding clarifications, providing errors, etc.
* **Review my suggested code** and tell me about issues or improvements, so I can iterate on it.

You can also ask me questions about your editor selection by [starting an inline chat session](:inlineChat.start).
